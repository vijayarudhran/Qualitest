Uploading the BDD(Cucumber), selenuim Automation script for the scenario shared.

While I was in middle of coding I got the message  "the website is  temporarily unable to service your request as it exceeded resource limit. Please try again later" and I am unable to proceed next. I emailed Mia Pearce(Senior Talent Partner) about it with screen shot however I have been asked to try later as it is third party application and dont have control on the Issue. Still I am having Issue in accessing web application shared to continue with coding. I have uploaded the code how much ever I worked on until error message raised. request to review the code and give additional/new slot to share the complete coding.

Com.Test.Vijaya\src\test\java\stepdefinition  --> Has main jave code equivalent/mapping to the feature file

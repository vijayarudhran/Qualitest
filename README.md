# Qualitest
Uploading the BDD(Cucumber), selenuim(Java) Automation script for the scenario shared.

Scenario 1: Order-T-shirt(and Verify in order history)
Scenario 2: Update Personal Information(First Name) in my Account.

I have uploaded Zip file as I am facing Issue in uploading folder to git hub private repository. Written the code in Cucumber-Java, selenuim using reuable code framework model.
Below is the Explanation of the code which will help during reviewing it.

1) Main File to be executable --> pom.xml or TestRunner.Java(Com.Test.vijaya\QualiTest\src\test\java\com\Test\runners
2) Main file calls Feature file for two scenario that is present in the path --> Com.Test.vijaya\QualiTest\src\test\resources\features
3) Feature file has equivalent step definition file that is present in the path--> Com.Test.vijaya\QualiTest\target\test-classes\features
4) Action file for step definition file(framework model) is present in the path --> Com.Test.vijaya\QualiTest\src\test\java\com\Test\app
5) Utility file that has re-usable code for general web UI actions(framework model) are present in the path --> Com.Test.vijaya\QualiTest\src\test\java\com\Test\utils
6) Used extent reporting format for reports and report is available in the path --> Com.Test.vijaya\\QualiTest\target\SparkReport

Code is written in framework model and could complete for first scenario as I was getting message "the website is  temporarily unable to service your request as it exceeded resource limit. Please try again later" and I am unable to proceed next. I emailed Mia Pearce(Senior Talent Partner) about it with screen shot however I have been asked to try later as it is third party application and dont have control on the Issue. Still I am having Issue in accessing web application shared to continue with coding for second scenario.  I have uploaded the code how much ever I worked on until error message raised. request to review the code.
